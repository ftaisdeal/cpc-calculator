  <h1>Welcome to Skits &amp; Scripts</h1>
  Welcome to a unique and engaging group where people of many interests can come together to share skits and create
  memorable experiences. Our group is for people of all experience levels, with beginners encouraged. This is not an
  acting class, but a fun and interesting way for people to get together. We will explore various topics from serious to
  silly in a relaxed way as we expand ourselves and our social connections.

  <p>We are based in the Elmwood district of Berkeley on College Ave., only a block from the Elmwood Theater.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re here to try your hand at scriptwriting, expand your awareness or just have fun acting out skits,
    this in-person group is the perfect way to express yourself, learn about others and add a little more joy to your
    life. Participation is key, so we hope that everyone will be performing, writing and making new friends.</p>

  <p>We started out by using Meetup, but we want to be open to anyone, regardless of Meetup.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to participate but don't want to use Meetup, please contact me by phone or email:
